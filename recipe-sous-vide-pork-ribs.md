- BBQ sauce

Steps
-----
1. Combine the brown sugar, chili powder, 1 teaspoon black pepper, the oregano, cayenne, garlic powder and onion powder in a small bowl.
2. Rub the mixture on both sides of the ribs.
3. Seal sous-vide, add 4 drops of liquid smoke to each pouch
4. Cook sous-vide at 63 &deg; C for 20 hours.
5. Remove pouches from sous vide and place in ice-water, cool until melted fat has solidified.
6. Remove ribs from sous vide pouches and brush with BBQ sauce all over, wrap in foil.
7. Continue brushing with sauce every 20 - 30 mins, ~4 times total.
8. Grill on BBQ high heat until internal temperature exceeds 64 &deg; C. Continue to brush with BBQ sauce while grilling. A beautifully charred bark should develop.
