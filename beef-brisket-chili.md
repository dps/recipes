Ingredients
-----------
- 3 lbs beef brisket
- 2 red onions
- 4 jalapeno chillies
- 1 large cinnamon stick
- 1 tbsp ground cumin
- 1 tbsp paprika
- 1 heaped tbsp dried oregano
- 2 fresh bay leaves
- 2 red bell peppers
- 2 green bell peppers
- 800g tin chopped tomatoes
- 400g tin kidney beans
- 400ml beef stock
- 1/2 bunch coriander

Steps
-----
1. Place the cinnamon stick, cumin, paprika and oregano in a pestle and mortar. Bash and grind until the cinnamon is in very small flakes.
2. Score the beef and rub the spice mix into the cuts.
3. Season the beef and drizzle with olive oil.  Brown in a hot pan.
4. Finely slice the onion and fry in a little olive oil together with the chillies, finely sliced.  You can control the heat of your chili by deseeding some of the chillies.
5. Add the browned brisket to the pan with the onions and chillies and fry on a low heat.
6. Place the bell peppers, roughly sliced, the bay leaves and chopped tomatoes in a large covered pot.  Bring to the boil and then add the beef onions and chillies.
7. Bring back to the boil, cover and allow to simmer on a low heat for 4 hours.
8. Remove the brisket from the pot, place on a large plate and use two forks to pull the beef apart into individual pieces.
9. Remove the bay leaves and add the pulled beef and coriander back to the pot, together with the kidney beans.
10. Bring back to the boil and simmer gently for a further 15 - 20 mins.

Serving

Serve with rice, yoghurt and fresh guacamole.  Garnish with the remaining coriander.
